            Hey (hi icon), I&aposm Neeraj Mukta. I hail from a small town named
            Gondia[glocation] (the rice city of India). I was born and bought up
            here in a middle class family. My father is a Phd in English, also
            has a law degree and my mother is a homemaker & yogini. I have a
            younger brother (4 years younger) who is pursing M.Pharm. I had a
            pretty amazing childhood growing up in this small town where I spent
            most of my time outside playing sports with my neighborhood friends
            cricket and football being my favorite I play them even today. I did
            my schooling here and then moved to nearby city Nagpur(gloction) to
            prepare for JEE. But, I ended up going to VIT vellore for my
            bachelor&aposs in IT.

          <span> What I do? (1 min read) </span>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer if you go by degree and profession. But, I
            like to think of myself as a engineer, digital product engineer to
            be precise. Because with my five plus years of experience in
            developing consumer facing applications in various domains like B2B
            e-commerce, B2C e-commerce, Banking, FinTech, HealthTech, ESports
            and Entertainment I have developed skills and mindset that helps me
            create more impactful end to end solutions. I have worked with
            foreign clients, local clients, large teams and young startups. I
            built apps for all major platforms like web, windows, android and
            iOS. I have managed teams, dealt with stakeholders and delivered
            great projects. I also do technical blogging. I have tons of other
            interests like sports, marketing, and building communities. These
            days I work only with young and affluent companies helping them
            build their products and initial loyal customer base, solving that 0
            to 1 problem.

            researching, planning, developing and deploying end to end
            solutions.
