        I am a product engineer with five plus years of experience in developing
        customer facing applications for web, windows, android and iOS. I have
        contributed to more than 10 projects across various domains like B2B
        e-commerce, B2C e-commerce, Banking, FinTech, HealthTech, Esports and
        Entertainment. I have worked with foreign clients, local clients, large
        teams and young startups. I also share my experiences through content
        creation i.e technical blogging. I have experience in digital marketing,
        seo and growth. But, I specialize in idea to MVP. My knowledge is best
        put to use in researching, planning, developing and deploying end to end
        solutions for my clients. I work with early stage founders, non-tech
        founders to help them test their ideas quickly.
